 - Provide (idempotent?) postprocessors with a list of clusters that need to be revisited instead of traversing the full tree.
 - Add possibility to let graph builders know the size in advance
 - Better serialization
 - Maybe run some initial iterations before checking sigtrail
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's
 - Measure amount of noise during Power iteration
