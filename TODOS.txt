 - Update documentation: parent similarity metric, new numChildren default 0

 - Unify postprocessor using subclasses instead of the interface
 - Make it possible to deactivate some postprocessors (e.g. minChildren == 0)
 - Postprocessing pipeline configuration

 - Maybe run some initial iterations before checking sigtrail
 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's
 - Measure amount of noise during Power iteration
