 - NCut: Look into triangular-style traversal
 - NCut: Check whether using the hash set is faster than performing a regular search
 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - ParentSimilarityPostprocessor is awfully slow. Look into binary/interpolative search to find a suitable ancestor
 - Make maxIterations depend on the graph size (mind those nasty alternating beasts!)
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Parallel cluster tree traversal (?)
 - Fix size <-> order nomenclature issues
 - Check whether it makes sense to attach the root graph to all cluster objects instead of passing it everywhere
 - Prevent singletons from ever being created in the first place. Possibly apply the parent similarity PP right away too.
