 - Vertex affiliation postprocessing is suspiciously fast. Check if it aggregates
 - Check whether fast predicate checking in parent similarity transformer might work (i.e. similarity is monotonous)
 - Better serialization
 - Maybe run some initial iterations before checking sigtrail
 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's
 - Measure amount of noise during Power iteration
