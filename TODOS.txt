 - Move overlap from graph to only class using it
 - Try out having a more strict consistency threshold for the postfilter
 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's

Notes / explore:

  - Use the signum of the most stable vertex as reference for normalize2Sig
  - Maybe run some initial iterations before checking sigtrail
  - Measure amount of noise during Power iteration
  - Explore flicker factor as alternative to convergence threshold
