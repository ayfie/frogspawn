 - Fastutil's latest version now supports merge sort on big arrays. Check if replacing custom (big) arrays is an option here
 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - Make maxIterations depend on the graph size (mind those nasty alternating beasts!)
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Parallel cluster tree traversal (?)
 - Fix size <-> order nomenclature issues
