 - Make postprocessing optional, i.e. add as separate stage that needs to be applied manually
 - Test settings builders and defaults
 - Rename settings getters
 - Make it possible to deactivate some postprocessors (e.g. minChildren == 0)
 - Change documentation
 - Test for postprocessor determinism
 - Postprocessing pipeline configuration

 - Maybe run some initial iterations before checking sigtrail
 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's
 - Measure amount of noise during Power iteration
