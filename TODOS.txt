 - Make maxIterations depend on the graph size (mind those nasty alternating beasts!)
 - Sample initial vector by pre-solving a smaller matrix
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - Check graph for biparity upon creation
 - Remove synchronized everywhere
 - CUDA
 - Parallel cluster tree traversal
