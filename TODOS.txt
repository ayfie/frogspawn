 - ConsistencyGuard: else if survivors.size() == minClusterSize => Shouldn't this return a new graph(survivors)?
 - Additional intra-cluster consistency?
 - Try out having a more strict consistency threshold for the postfilter
 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's
