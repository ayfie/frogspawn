 - Find out why some vertices are lost
 - Make maxIterations depend on the graph size (mind those nasty alternating beasts!)
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Parallel cluster tree traversal (?)
 - Fix size <-> order nomenclature issues
 - Check whether it makes sense to attach the root graph to all cluster objects instead of passing it everywhere
