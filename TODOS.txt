 - Explore optimization (early termination) potential w. regards to min size in combination with singleton collapsing
 - Make maxIterations depend on the graph size (mind those nasty alternating beasts!)
 - Write some proper math documentation
 - CUDA
 - Parallel cluster tree traversal (?)
 - Fix size <-> order nomenclature issues
 - Check whether it makes sense to replace custom big array with fastutil's
